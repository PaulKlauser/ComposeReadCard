# Google Pay OCR with Compose

Barebones example of [Google Pay debit and credit card recognition](https://developers.google.com/pay/payment-card-recognition/debit-credit-card-recognition) 
built with Compose. 

Used as an exploration of the `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` API and serving as an 
example of one way to abstract an `ActivityResultContract` when integrating with a 3rd 
party.
